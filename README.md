Arrow Keys for Ducky one 2 mini 
###################################

-Basically what you need is to installl AutoHotKeys, where you can download at:

	https://www.autohotkey.com/

After installing the program you can play around with the keyboard layout
Copy  Ducky_arrow.ahk to your computer and run it!

You can also make it run on startup so it's easier for everyday use.
For that you just need to:

	1. Press Windows+R to open the "Run" dialog Box
	2.Type "shell:startup" and then hit Enter to open the "Startup" folder.
	3. Copy the Ducky_arrow.ahk to the folder.

After this the sript will run on startup.

I didn't find a script for my keyboard layout (PT), and i needed one that 
whould retain the AltGr and Right Shift functions.
